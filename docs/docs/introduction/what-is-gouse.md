# Introduction

## ðŸ§  Why Gouse?

- Gouse is a modern essential [`Golang`](https://golang.org/) utility package delivering consistency, modularity, performance, & extras presets inspired by [`Lodash`](https://lodash.com/).
- `Javascript` user-friendly syntax.
- No config - import as utility functions.
- Lightweight package: easy to use, chainable, and extendable, and available in various builds & module formats.
- Gouse provides a wide variety of available methods, taking the hassle out of working with arrays, numbers, objects, strings, etc. Each method has different features, so you can pick the ones that fit your project best.
- Comprehensive documentation and examples.
- Powerful package that is suitable for small to large projects and compatible with all OS platforms
- Thanks to Gouse, you can:
  - Set up and scale projects rapidly.
  - Handle complex logic use-cases such as database connection, build APIs, error handling, log management...
  - Optimize performance and increase productivity.
  - Build easily consistent systems with available functions.
  - Avoid writing repetitive code and a unified code style.
  - Reduce the number of lines of code and make it easier to read, understand, and maintain.
  - Avoid compatibility conflicts and unexpected errors.
  - And more...

## âœ¨ Motivation

- Go has emerged as a server language, but it still doesn't have complete and consistent packages available to support coding development.
  - Developers must write by hand or search manually. That wastes time and even causes many compatibility conflicts
  - Must update each dependent package every time you update
  - Unexpected errors can easily arise during execution
  - Performance is not optimized
  - The number of lines of code is very long that not easy to read and understand
  - Code logic may not be consistent, making it difficult to maintain and scale

ðŸ‘‰ To address that need, Gouse was created as a powerful toolkit for Go developers, a collection of built-in functions and best practices that provide comprehensive, powerful, and reliable solutions. Trusted to build services, APIs, and web applications.

## ðŸš€ Module packages
