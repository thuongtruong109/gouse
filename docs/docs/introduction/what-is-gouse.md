# Introduction

## ðŸ§  Why Gouse?

- Gouse is a modern essentials [`Golang`](https://golang.org/) utility package delivering consistency, modularity, performance, and extras presets.
- Built on top of Go language, and others Go open-source packages.
- Inspired by [`Lodash`](https://lodash.com/) so `Javascript` user-friendly syntax.
- Lightweight package: easy to use, chainable, extendable, available.
- Gouse provides a wide variety of available methods, taking the hassle out of working with any type requests. So you can pick the one of them that fit your project demands.
- Powerful package of built-in functions provide comprehensive, and reliable solutions for any project size and compatible with all OS platforms.
- Open-source, free to use, and contribute.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features

Thanks to Gouse, you can:

- Set up and scale projects rapidly.
- No config - import directly as utility functions.
- Handle complex logic use-cases such as database connection, build APIs, error handling, log management...
- Optimize performance and increase productivity.
- Build easily consistent systems with available functions.
- Avoid writing repetitive code and a unified code style.
- Reduce the number of lines of code and make it easier to read, understand, and maintain.
- Avoid compatibility conflicts and unexpected errors.
- Works smoothly in any environment and platform.
- Easy to learn and use, suitable for beginners and experts.
- Compatible with all frameworks and libraries.
- Referencing examples with comprehensive documentation
- And more...

## âœ¨ Motivation

- Go has emerged as a server language, but it still doesn't have complete and consistent packages available to support coding development.
- Developers must write by hand or search manually. That wastes time and even causes many compatibility conflicts.
- Must update each dependent package every time when project update.
- Unexpected errors can easily arise during execution.
- Performance is not optimized.
- The number of lines of code is very long that not easy to read and understand.
- Code logic may not be consistent, making it difficult to maintain and scale.
- Hard to make sure the programs are executed the same across all environments.
- Lack of coherent learning materials and examples.
- And more...

ðŸ‘‰ To address that need, Gouse was created as a powerful presets toolkit for Go developers, a collection of built-in functions and best practices that provide comprehensive, powerful, and reliable solutions. Trusted to build services, software platforms, APIs, and web applications.
